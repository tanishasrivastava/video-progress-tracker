- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- localStorage API

## **Description üìÉ**
- A React.js-based application that tracks the progress of a video as the user watches it. The app saves the video playback position so that users can resume from where they left off.
- Automatically saves and resumes video playback ‚Äî making content consumption smooth and uninterrupted for users.
- Built with React and Vite, demonstrating proficiency in modern, high-performance frontend tooling and component-driven development.

## **Functionalities üéÆ**
- Tracks the user's watch time and resumes video from the exact point they left off.
- Stores playback time locally in the browser ‚Äî no backend required.
- Modular and reusable VideoPlayer component built using modern React hooks.
- Updates playback progress at regular intervals for accuracy and performance.

## **üõ† Implementation Insights**
- Tracking of Watched Intervals - The app listens to the video‚Äôs timeupdate event and captures playback time every few seconds. These time points are stored as interval objects (with start and end) in localStorage, ensuring progress is saved even if the user closes the tab or reloads the page.
- Calculation of Unique Progress - To avoid counting overlapping or repeated watch segments, a merging algorithm is used. It sorts all stored intervals and merges any that overlap, giving a precise total of uniquely watched time. This ensures progress reflects actual coverage, not just duration played.
  
-  Challenges & Solutions
1.  Initially, intervals were recorded on every timeupdate, which fires very often, leading to redundant and noisy data.
Solution -> Switched to a setInterval-based throttling (e.g., one interval every second) to balance accuracy and performance.
2.  localStorage had limitations for multiple users or large-scale data
Solution -> For this project, localStorage was acceptable due to its scope (local video player). But noted that for real-world use, a backend or cloud-based sync would be essential.
3. When users scrubbed back or replayed a section, duplicate time chunks inflated the watch progress.
Solution ->Wrote a merging algorithm that consolidated overlapping or adjacent intervals into a clean list of non-overlapping segments before summing their lengths.
